          <h2>To Cook the Best Spaghetti We Have a Few Simple Tricks</h2>
          <p>Check the package directions of the spaghetti you plan to cook. On the box, there should be an approximate cook time for “al-dente,” which means the pasta will be tender, but not mushy. It will still have a bit of a bite, which is perfect.

            When you know the suggested cook time, set a timer for a minute or so before it. So if the box suggests 10 minutes, set a timer for 8 minutes.
            
            This way, at the 8-minute mark, you can check on the spaghetti to make sure it is not done already. The box directions are a helpful guide, but its always a good idea to check the pasta early!</p>
          <p>Cook the spaghetti in salted water. The water should taste salty. This seasons the pasta as it cooks and is necessary for the best-tasting pasta.

            Toss the cooked spaghetti with a flavorful sauce — like our homemade spaghetti sauce. Dont just spoon the sauce on top of the pasta.</p>
